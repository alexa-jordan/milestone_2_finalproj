Milestone 2: 

Project 1: Amy Zhou, "Caselaw Through the Years" 

For my first project, I decided to investigate a realm of academia that I am very fascinated in: the law and gender! It just so happens that Amy also had the same Expos preceptor (Sparsha Saha) that I had during my freshman year.

Only a few minutes on this shinyapp, and I am extremely impressed with what I have found in her project. Amy had to do a significant amount of wrangling to have a successful project. See her testimony below: 

"I downloaded the bulk data for all 50 states and began working with it. I immediately ran into some issues. First, the actual text of the cases were nested in a list within a data frame within another data frame, so I had to write a function (with the help of Alyssa). to extract this and bind it to the data. A similar issue occurred with the court names and court slugs." 

This project looks extremely hard, but it makes me very excited to research my own topic very soon.

Pro: 
- 

Con: 
- My first critiqueSome of it doesn't work! I tried on several different computers. The tab that shows the "Term Usage Over Time" just doesn't work
