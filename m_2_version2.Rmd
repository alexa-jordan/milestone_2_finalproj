Milestone 2:

Project 1: Amy Zhou, "Caselaw Through the Years"
For my first project, I decided to investigate a realm of academia that I am
very fascinated in: the law and gender! It just so happens that Amy also had the
same Expos preceptor (Sparsha Saha) that I had during my freshman year.

Only a few minutes on this shinyapp, and I am extremely impressed with what I
have found in her project. Amy had to do a significant amount of wrangling to
have a successful project. See her testimony below:

"I downloaded the bulk data for all 50 states and began working with it. I
immediately ran into some issues. First, the actual text of the cases were
nested in a list within a data frame within another data frame, so I had to
write a function (with the help of Alyssa). to extract this and bind it to the
data. A similar issue occurred with the court names and court slugs."
This project looks extremely hard, but it makes me very excited to research my
own topic very soon.

Pro: 
- The wrangling of data in this final project is immaculate. It is well
organized and the options are impressive. The github is also neatly organized. 
- It is very thorough and a lot of options are available for the reader, it is
clearly a complex topic that Amy has thought a lot about.

Con: 
- My first critique is very simple. It either has too much data for my
computer to handle, or her tabs just do not work! I tried on several different
computers in my house, all with the same  effect. The tab that shows the "Term
Usage Over Time" just doesn't work, for example. It is good in concept, but it
causes my computer to crash each time, so we need to figure out how to stop this
from happening to other visitors to the site.

- Amy chose Gender & the SUPREME court. I think this tab was not fully thought
out for several reasons: 
1. The sample size of women is so much smaller than the
number of men who have argued in front of the supreme court. How do I know if
the difference is significant, or just a product of a small sample size? 
2. I think that this piece of analysis was way too short. No additional research was
done to explain why women win at a higher rate. A passing comment on "theories"
does not tell us anything about the data and what we should learn from it. Even
if you do not put forth reasons or ONE reason that you believe is causing this,
I think we would benefit from what others may think. In summary: WHY does this
matter? 
3. It looks dull! Amy needs some more pretty color in her graphs.



Project #2
Benjamin Villaw's "The Sacred and the Profane: Metropolitan Emotions"
Pro's: - Upon opening the assignment, I already see a nice image and looks both
clean and futuristic. The question he is trying to answer is clear: how do
different factors affect mental helath and emotional well-being. Clearly,
Benjamin is going to be looking for a causal effect. - His data source is CLEAR
and highlighted on the intro/welcoming page. - Uh, Dan if you're reading this...
I am floored. This project is phenomenal. I actually hit the jackpot! I soon
realized why this might be the case: "Benjamin Villa Wiesner is an Architect and
a Design Engineer from Harvardâ€™s Graduate School of Design and the School of
Engineering and Applied Sciences. You can reach me at
"benjaminvilla@mde.harvard".edu and find me on GitHub." HAHA this guy is in
graduate school for design. - He had his own "build your own regression table!"
Con's:
- He didn't interpret for me, so I dont know what the answer to his question is!
